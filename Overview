Rambutans

I enjoy eating rambutans, which I first tasted when visiting the Big Island, Hawaii. There was a roadside fruit stand that offering these small and soft, yet prickly red balls. It looked more like an addition to a floral arrangement, rather than something that you'd eat. But my were those little rambutans tastey.
